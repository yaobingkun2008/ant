Author/Contact: Ziqiu Yao yaobingkun2008@126.com

Description:
	ANT is a simple model for implementing the ant algorithm on mote Micaz/Telosb, and use TOSSIM for simulation. The project is still under design & programming.
Tools:
	TOSSIM
	generate_grid is for generating grid topology for simulating
Known bugs/limitations:
	Due to the the packet loss rate is very high. ACKs (maybe other methods )can be used to solve the problem.
